    <h1>Origami Pet</h1>
    <p>You've been asked to attend an Origami Pet from the local Folded Zoo.
        This pet has plenty of needs and you must help the keeper and this Pet
        thrive. Click around the Pet's environment to see what keeps its needs in check!
        Be careful, it the Pet's needs drop below a critical level, it will hibernate 
        until you take good care once more.
